# RecipeBookFlutter
Here We will be making an app which will use an api calling to create a recipe book from https://www.food2fork.ca/. It will have a lot of queries to be tackle with.
We will make an app where first screen will show the list of common cooking items such as Eggs, Chicken, Beef etc, and a search bar.
Then Second Page will take us to different recipies of that item along with a photo and a rating, if we press any of that item it will show the list of ingredients.
We will try to use on flutter in this Application.
