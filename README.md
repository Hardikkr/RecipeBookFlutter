## 📌 Introduction

Here We will be making an app which will use an api calling to create a recipe book from https://www.food2fork.ca/. It will have a lot of queries to be tackle with. We will make an app where first screen will show the list of common cooking items such as Eggs, Chicken, Beef etc, and a search bar. Then Second Page will take us to different recipies of that item along with a photo and a rating, if we press any of that item it will show the list of ingredients. We will try to use on flutter in this Application.

# FAQ

1. **I have exams till mid-December. What to do? Can I still participate?**  
Yes, definitely! You can register anytime during the entire duration of the program and start contributing to the various projects. It is never late to contribute to the projects :-)

1. **What prizes shall I receive?**  
Apart from a digital certificate from NJACK IIT Patna, whatever merchandise and some swags we obtain from the sponsors, would be distributed among the active contributors. 

    **Letter of Recommendation (LoRs) from NJACK, IIT Patna can be provided to the top and active contributors on review of their work.**

    However, we would like to emphasise on the fact that this is more of a program to encourage Open Source, rather than a contest. So, your aim should be to learn along with the community and enjoy working on the projects, rather than to compete to get to the top. Cheers :-)

1. **Which language should I know to participate in NWoC?**  
We will try to include projects in almost all common programming languages. However, you will have to work with Git and GitHub to contribute to any of the projects. You can learn to use these during NWoC itself, or you can start learning them from https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud775.
